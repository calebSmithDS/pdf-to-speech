Background: Vaping by young people in Australia is a rapidly emerging public health issue. Evidence shows that 
parental  behaviours  and  attitudes  can  play  a  key  role  in  influencing  adolescent  behaviours.  Considering  the 
health  harms  of  vaping  and  evidence  that  it  can  be  a  gateway  to  tobacco  smoking  for  never-smokers,  it  is 
important  to  understand  whether  parents’  smoking  and  vaping  behaviours  influence  their  teenage  children’s 
smoking and vaping behaviours. 
Methods: Online cross-sectional surveys as part of the Generation Vape study, conducted in Australia in 2021/ 
2022, were used to assess parents’ influence on, and awareness of, one of their 14–17-year-old child’s vaping and 
smoking behaviours. Participants were 3242 parents and 3242 14–17-year-old teenage children. 
Results: The risk of vaping and smoking uptake among 14–17-year-old teenagers was 42% (p = 0.003) and 97% 
(p < 0.001) higher, respectively, if their parent was an ever-vaper. The risk of vaping and smoking uptake among 
teenagers was 81% (p < 0.001) and 159% (p < 0.001) higher, respectively, if their parent was an ever-smoker. 
Parents of teenagers who have not vaped were considerably better at correctly predicting this (97% correct) than 
parents  of  teenagers  who  have  vaped  (70%  correct).  Compared  to  parents,  teenagers  tended  to  have  less 
agreement with statements suggesting vaping is unsafe or harmful, and more agreement with statements sug-
gesting vaping is relatively safe. 
Conclusions:  Parental  smoking  and vaping  behaviours  are  associated  with  those  of  their  children. Hence,  it  is 
important that both tobacco and vaping control policies and interventions are designed to influence behaviours 
of all demographics, consistent with the evidence.   

1. Introduction 

Vaping by young people in Australia is an emerging public health 
issue,  with  national  estimates  showing  that  in  2019,  about  1  in  4 
(26.1%) Australians aged 18–24 had tried a vape at least once, up from 
19.2%  in  2016  .  In 
New  South  Wales  (NSW),  Australia’s  most  populous  state,  the  most 
recent estimates (2021) show that among those over 16, rates of ever- 
vaping  are  highest  among  16–24  year  olds,  with  32.7%  having  ever 
used a vape . In response to this rapid 
increase, the Generation Vape study tracks attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, 

and  behaviours  related  to  vaping,  with  data  collected  in  6-monthly 
waves starting in September 2021 . 

The  growth  in  vape  use  among  young  people  is  a  serious  public 
health  risk  given  the  well-established  harmful  effects  of  nicotine,  the 
known and emerging health impacts of vaping, and the increased risk of 
future tobacco smoking initiation. Nicotine use in adolescence is asso-
ciated with attention and mood disorders , and brain development issues ,  and  there’s  strong  evidence  that  never- 
smokers  who  vape  are  more  likely  to  subsequently  initiate  tobacco 
smoking than those who do not vape (Banks et al., 2022; Yoong et al.,

Egger et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

2021).  There  is  also  evidence  that  vaping  is  harmful  to  health,  with 
outcomes including lung injury, poisoning and toxicity from inhalation, 
addiction and burns and trauma . 

While  studies  report  that  young  people  experiment  with  vaping 
products for reasons such as flavours , ease of access , and cost , parental behaviours and at-
titudes may also play a significant role. Not only is parental smoking a 
key  risk  factor  for  adolescent  smoking  , but research has also shown that parental knowledge 
of  adolescents’  activities  is  linked  to  positive  youth  adjustment  and 
reduced engagement in risky behaviours like tobacco use . Given these factors, it is plausible 
that a similar dynamic  of parental vaping  and parental knowledge of 
their  child’s  vaping  could  influence  adolescent  vaping  behaviours. 
Initial research shows that adolescents perceive their parents feel that 
vaping  is  “less  wrong”  than  smoking,  and  that  such  perceptions  are 
associated with adolescent vaping . Adolescents often 
start vaping using a device obtained from a family member and receive 
positive messages from within the family about vaping . Parents could be a key group for targeted prevention education, 
given  their  potential  influence  on  adolescent  behaviours  . 

In the current paper, we analysed data from the first three waves of 
the Generation Vape study, focusing on the 3242 adolescents who had a 
parent jointly participate in the Generation Vape study (wave 3 was the 
most recent data available at the time the analysis commenced). In doing 
this, we were able to examine parents’  awareness around one of their 
adolescent child’s vaping habits, and to assess the effect of that parent’s 
smoking  and  vaping  behaviours  on  their  child’s  smoking  and  vaping 
behaviours. 

2. Methods 

2.1. Study design 

This study is part of the larger Generation Vape project, designed to 
examine  vaping  and  smoking  behaviour,  product  awareness,  percep-
tions,  attitudes,  and  knowledge  across  four  groups  (14–17-year-olds, 
18–24-year-olds, parents of 14–17-year-olds, and secondary school ed-
ucators) at multiple times over three years using both qualitative and 
quantitative  methods.  Data  was  obtained  from  the  first  three  survey 
waves of 14–17-year-olds and their parents or guardians, conducted in 
September 2021, April 2022, and September 2022, with mostly different 
participants  in  each  wave,  but  with  some  repeat  participants.  The 
questionnaire  was  pre-tested  with  young  people  and  parents  before 
administration.

2.2. Participants 

^ Parent-specific variable not asked of teenagers. 

Eligible  teenage  participants  were  14–17  years  old  and  eligible 
‘parent’ participants were parents or guardians of children aged 14–17 
who were not high school teachers or administrators. Participants were 
recruited through online panels, for waves 2 and 3 Australia-wide and 
for  wave  1,  NSW  residents  only.  Teenage  participants  were  recruited 
either  directly  via  email  or  indirectly  through  their  parents,  and  vice 
versa.  The  analyses  were  limited  to  the  3242  teen  and  parent  pairs 
participating in the study (Table 1). The study includes parent-teen pairs 
only because only these data allow us to assess the associations between 
parental actions and awareness with the smoking/vaping behaviours of 
their own teenage children. Of these 3242 parent-teenager pairs, 595 
contained a teenager and/or parent that participated in more than one 
wave; for these pairs, only their earliest wave data were included. 

vapes  or  e-cigarettes?”.  The  latter  ensured  only  those  with  prior 
knowledge of vaping could participate. Key demographic characteristics 
were monitored to ensure a representative sample, and pre-established 
caps  were  placed  on  gender  and  age.  Parental  consent  was  required 
for all 14–17-year-olds. Participants also had to consent after receiving a 
Participant Information Statement. Ethics approval was granted by the 
University  of  Sydney  Human  Research  Ethics  Committee  (project 
number 2021/442) in July 2021. 

2.3. Measures 

2.3.1. Sociodemographic variables 

Both teenage and parent respondents had to answer three screening 
questions  to  confirm  eligibility.  These  questions  were  “What  is  your 
postcode?”, “How old are you?”  and “Have you ever seen or heard of 

Demographic  characteristics  of  teenage  and  parent  participants 
included gender, age, remoteness of residence area (metro, non-metro 
areas), socioeconomic status (SES) of the residence area (divided into

quintiles)  ,  language  spoken  at 
home (English and/or another language) and Aboriginal or Torres Strait 
Islander status. Parents were asked about their highest education level 
and household income per year, and teens were asked about their cur-
rent school year. 

2.3.2. Parents awareness of their teenage child’s vaping usage 

Parents were asked “As far as you know, has your child (or any of 
your children aged 14–17) ever vaped?”. Response options were “Yes, 
they definitely have”, “I strongly suspect they have”, “I don’t think they 
have”, “I am confident they have not” and “I don’t know”. 

2.3.3. Safety of vaping perceptions 

All  participants  were  asked  their  level  of  agreement  on  a  5-point 
Likert  scale  (with  agreement  scored  from  ‘strongly  disagree’=1  to 
‘strongly agree’=5 for analysis) with 8 statements relating to the safety 
of vaping. The statements were “Vapes are unsafe to use”, “Vaping can 
harm the developing brain”, “Vaping can damage the lungs”, “Vaping 
during  adolescence  can  cause  addiction”,  “It  is  unsafe  to  use  vapes 
around others”, “Vapes are healthier than smoking tobacco cigarettes”, 
“Vapes help smokers to quit” and “Nicotine is harmless”. 

2.3.4. Parental vaping and smoking (risk factors variables) 

The risk factors of interest for teenagers’ smoking and vaping habits 
were their parent’s vaping and smoking habits. Consequently, “parent 
vape status” was derived as a dichotomous variable (ever-vaper, never- 
vaper), with ever-vapers defined as self-reported ex- or current-vapers. 
Similarly,  “parent  smoke  status”  was  derived  as  a  dichotomous  vari-
able (ever-smoker, never-smoker), with ever-smokers self-reported ex- 
or current-smokers of “cigarettes, roll your own (rollies), cigars, shisha 
 pipes”. Additional questions asked of parents (but not of teenagers) 
allowed us to also create 3-category “parent vape status”  and “parent 
smoke status”  variables dividing the ever-user categories into ex- and 
current- user categories. 

2.3.5. Teenager vaping status and smoking status (outcome variables) 

Primary outcomes were teenagers’ smoking status and vaping status. 
Consequently,  “teenager  vape  status”  was  derived  as  a  dichotomous 
outcome (ever-vaper, never-vaper), with ever-vapers defined as having 
vaped on at least 10 occasions (and with never-vapers being those who 
are not ever-vapers). Similarly, “teenager smoke status” was derived as a 
dichotomous outcome (ever-smoker, never-smoker), with ever-smokers 
defined  as having smoked at least 10 cigarettes including “cigarettes, 
roll  your  own  (rollies),  cigars,  shisha    pipes”  (and  never-smokers 
being those who are not ever-smokers). 

2.3.6. Teenager prior vaping and prior smoking (confounder variables) 

A potential confounder of the effects of parental smoking/vaping on 
teenager smoking is teenagers’  e-cigarette use prior to the use of any 
combustible tobacco product. Similarly, a potential confounder of the 
effects  of  parental  smoking/vaping  on  teenager  vaping  is  teenagers’ 
combustible  tobacco  use  prior  to  the  use  of  any  e-cigarette  product. 
Hence, we constructed the dichotomous variables “teenager prior vap-
ing”  and  “teenager  prior  smoking”  using  teenagers’  vaping  status, 
smoking status and responses to the question “Which did you try first: 
vaping or smoking?” (which was asked of teenagers who had tried both 
smoking  and  vaping).  Specifically,  teenagers  were  classified  “yes”  for 
“teenager prior vaping” if they had initiated vaping prior to any use of 
combustible tobacco products. They were classified “no” if they had not 
initiated  vaping  prior to  any use of  combustible  tobacco  products (ie 
either never vaped or started vaping but not prior to trying a combus-
tible  tobacco  product).  Similarly,  teenagers  were  classified  “yes”  for 
“teenager prior smoking” if they had initiated smoking prior to any use 
of e-cigarettes, and “no” if they had not initiated smoking prior to any 
use of e-cigarettes. 

2.4. Statistical methods 

The  accuracy  of  parents’  belief  about  whether  their  teenage  child 
had  tried  vaping  was  assessed  using  Cohen’s  kappa  statistic.  For  this 
analysis,  parents  who  reported  “I  don’t  think  they  have”  or  “I  am 
confident they have not” were categorised as believing their child had 
not tried vaping, and those who reported “Yes, they definitely have” or 
“I strongly suspect they have” were categorised as believing their child 
had tried vaping. Cohen’s kappa can be interpreted as the probability of 
agreement  beyond  chance  (i.e.,  adjusted  for  the  probability  of  agree-
ment at random). As a rule of thumb for kappa values, Landis and Koch 
suggested  the  following  categories:  Perfect  (kappa  = 1.00),  Almost 
Perfect  (0.81–1.00),  Substantial  (0.61–0.80),  Moderate  (0.41–0.60), 
Fair  . In addition, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
value (PPV) and negative predicted value (NPV) of parents’ belief about 
whether their teenage child had tried vaping were also calculated. For 
the 8 statements relating to the safety of vaping, mean differences be-
tween parent and teenage children in agreement scores were calculated 
using  regression  analyses  with  generalised  estimating  equation  (GEE) 
adjustment of standard errors for the clustering of parent and teenager 
pairs . 

2.4.1. Main analysis 

Poisson regression with robust variance was used to assess the effects 
of parents’ vaping and smoking behaviours (independent variables) on 
teenagers’ ever-vaping and ever-smoking status (dependent variables), 
with relative risk (RR) as the effect measure and with other independent 
variables listed below the relevant tables. We chose RR as the measure of 
effect  due  to  its  ease  of  interpretation  and  for  consistency  with  our 
previous publication . 

2.4.2. Supplementary analysis 

First, we re-ran our main analysis but with the dependent variables 
“recent  ever-vaper”  and  “recent  ever-smoker”  for  teenagers,  respec-
tively, redefined as having vaped on at least 10 occasions and having 
vaped in the past 30 days, and as having smoked at least 10 cigarettes 
and having smoked in the past 30 days (Supplementary Table 1). Wave 1 
data were excluded from this analysis because many regions in Australia 
were in strict lockdowns due to COVID-19 outbreaks, thus affecting past 
30-day  vaping  and  smoking  measures.  Second,  we  re-ran  our  main 
analysis  but  after  recategorizing  teenagers  who  have:  1)  smoked  less 
than 10 cigarettes in their lifetime as ever-smokers rather than never- 
smokers  and  2)  vaped  on  less  than  10  occasions  in  their  lifetime  as 
ever-vapers rather than never-vapers (Supplementary Table 2). Third, 
we repeated our main analysis using logistic regression to estimate odds 
ratios (ORs), thus allowing our estimates to be compared—and poten-
tially  pooled  in  future  meta-analyses—with  estimates  from  similar 
studies who estimated ORs (Supplementary Table 3). 

3. Results 

3.1. Participant characteristics 

Among the 3242 teenagers, 52% were male, 6% were Aboriginal or 
Torres Strait Islanders, 76% lived in a metropolitan area and 94% spoke 
English only at home (Table 1). Among the teenagers, 95% had never 
smoked  at  least  10  cigarettes,  thus  classified  as  ’never-smokers,’  and 
91% had not vaped on at least 10 occasions, thus classified as ’never- 
vapers’(Table 2). Additionally, 77% had not smoked even a few puffs, 
and 71% had not vaped even a few puffs. The distributions of charac-
teristics between teenage study participants in the paired sample anal-
ysis of the current study and all teenagers in the Generation Vape study 
were  generally  similar,  with  the  exception  that  the  entire  group  was 
slightly older (Supplementary Table 4). Among the 3242 parents, 33% 
were  male,  4%  were  Aboriginal  or  Torres  Strait  Islanders,  and  91%

ever-vapers (180/305) had never smoked (Table 2). 

3.2. Parents awareness of their teenage child’s vaping usage 

There was ’substantial’ agreement between parents’ beliefs and the 
reality  of  their  teenage  child  having  tried  vaping  (kappa  = 0.73) 
(Table 3). Specifically, 89% of parents who predicted their child had not 
tried  vaping  were  correct,  while  95%  of  parents  who  predicted  their 
child had tried vaping were correct. Parents of teenagers who had not

(sensitivity = 70%). 

3.3. Safety of vaping perceptions 

For both parents and teenagers, ever-vapers had lower mean agree-
ment  scores  for  all  five  negative  statements  about  vaping  safety  than 
their never-vaper counterparts (Table 4). Conversely, ever-vapers had 
higher  mean  agreement scores for  all three  positive statements about 
vaping  safety  than  their  never-vaper  counterparts.  Ever-vapers  also 
agreed on average (that is, they had mean scores above the neutral score 
of 3) with the five negative statements about vaping safety, except for "it 
is  unsafe  to  use  vapes  around  others"  among  teenage  ever-vapers. 
Compared  to  parents,  teenagers  had  significantly  lower  mean  agree-
ment  scores  for  all  five  negative  statements  about  vaping  safety,  and 
significantly  lower  mean  agreement  scores  for  all  the  three  positive 
statements about vaping safety. 

3.4. The effects of parents’ vaping and smoking on teenagers’ vaping and 
smoking 

3.4.1. Main analyses 

After adjustment for factors listed below Table 5, the risk of vaping 
uptake for teenagers was 42% higher (RR = 1.42, 95% CI ) if 
their  parent  was  an  ever-vaper  (compared  to  never-vaper).  Similarly, 
teenagers whose parent was an ever-smoker had a 81% higher risk of 
vaping uptake (RR = 1.81, 95% CI ) than teenagers whose 
parent was a never-smoker. The risk of smoking uptake was 97% higher 
(RR  = 1.97,  95%  CI)  for  teenagers  whose  parent  was  an 
ever-vaper  (compared to never-vaper),  and 159% higher  (RR = 2.59, 
95%  CI)  for  teenagers  whose  parent  was  an  ever-smoker 
(compared to never-smoker). 

3.4.2. Supplementary analysis 

Results from our analysis looking at teenagers’ recent (past 30 days) 
vaping and smoking behaviours as outcomes were similar in magnitude 
to those obtained from our main analysis (Supplementary Table 1). Es-
timates of effects were generally weaker after recategorizing teenagers 
who have: 1) smoked less than 10 cigarettes in their lifetime as ever- 
smokers rather than never-smokers and 2) vaped on less than 10 occa-
sions in their lifetime as ever-vapers rather than never-vapers (Supple-
mentary Table 2). For example, the adjusted RR for teenage smoking 
uptake according to parent smoke status decreased from RR = 2.59 in 
the  main  analysis  (Table  5)  to  RR  = 1.64  after  recategorizing  ever- 
smoker teenagers. 

4. Discussion 

Vaping  among  teenagers  has  been  highlighted  in  multiple  high- 
profile  Australian  media outlets  as  a  growing  concern among parents 
warranting  strong  public  health  action  (Australian  Broadcasting 

Corporation, 2022). Our study shows that parents in our sample were 
better at predicting their child’s vaping status if the child was a never- 
vaper.  This  aligns  with  other  research  showing  that  while  adolescent 
vaping overall is a concern to parents, their own children vaping is less 
concerning . Additionally, parents often discount the 
impact their own smoking and vaping has on children, attributing fac-
tors like peer pressure or teenage rebellion to harmful or risky behav-
iours . Our study shows that parental smoking and 
vaping are both independently associated with increased risks of their 
children  both  smoking  and  vaping.  Teenagers  in  our  study  viewed 
vaping  as  safer  and  less  harmful  than  their  parents  did,  which  may 
reflect  vaping  rates  being  higher  in  younger  age  groups  in  Australia 
. 

In our study, the adjusted relative risk of smoking uptake for teen-
agers was 159% higher if their participant parent was an ever-smoker, or 
173%  higher  odds in  terms  of  relative odds  (Supplementary Table  2) 
rather  than relative  risk. This  finding  is  considerably  higher  than the 
72% higher odds estimated in a 2011 meta-analysis of 10 studies from 11 
countries, none of which included Australia . 
While it is not entirely clear why our cohort had a substantially higher 
relative odds, one possibility could be that the 5% prevalence of teenage 
ever-smokers  in  our  study  is  notably  lower  than  the  study-specific 
teenage  smoking  prevalences  in  the  meta-analysis,  ranging  from  12% 
to 35%. That is, when the odds of smoking in the reference group is low, 
even a small absolute increase in the probability of smoking can produce 
a  disproportionately  large  odds  ratio.  We  also  found  that  teenagers 
whose parent was an ever-smoker had a 81% higher adjusted relative 
risk of vaping uptake (or 102% higher in terms of odds) than teenagers 
whose parent was a never-smoker. While our 102% higher odds estimate 
is also larger than the 41% reported in a 2018 meta-analysis of 10 studies 
from 9 countries , such 
differences  are  not  unexpected  given  that  e-cigarette  usage  is  rapidly 
evolving worldwide, and that vaping and smoking behaviours are likely 
to vary dramatically across cultures and countries. 

While many studies have examined the effects of parental smoking 
on  adolescent  smoking  and  vaping,  few  have  explored  the  effects  of 
parental vaping. A 2018 UK study of 1152 11–18-year-olds found sig-
nificant positive unadjusted associations between parental vaping and 
both youth smoking and vaping, but these became non-significant after 
adjustment  for  confounders  .  Another  UK  study  of 
3291 youth aged 10–15 years surveyed from 2015 to 2017 concluded 
that associations between parental and youth vaping were explained by 
measured confounding and that associations between parental vaping 
and youth smoking “could be explained by relatively weak unmeasured 
confounding” . In contrast, our study’s relationships 
between  parental vaping and  teenager vaping  and  smoking outcomes 
remained strong after adjustment, seeming less likely to be explained by 
weak unmeasured confounding. 

Consistent with tobacco control research, our results illustrate why 
both tobacco and vaping interventions and control policies should not 
focus solely on young people, but take a whole of population approach 
that benefits both adults and young people. This approach has already

proven successful in tobacco control in Australia, with comprehensive 
programs and interventions such as mass media campaigns, smoke free 
policies and restrictions on industry marketing targeted to the general 
population  playing  key  roles  . 
Despite  this  success,  vaping  rates  are  rising  in  Australia,  particularly 
amongst  young  people  . Moreover, given the considerable evidence of increased risks of 
smoking uptake in non-smokers who initiate vaping , there is a risk that e-cigarette use in young Aus-
tralians could undo decades of successful whole-of-population tobacco 
control policies. While the family setting plays a role in vaping uptake by 
young people, it is important not to overlook other key drivers such as 
product design, marketing, and accessibility. Ensuring that parents are 
well supported by an environment that reinforces that vaping products 
are only accessible to smokers who may benefit from use as a cessation 
aid is crucial. Shifting responsibility for adolescent vaping solely onto 
parents  ignores the  role of commercial  actors, including retailers  and 
importers illegally selling highly appealing products to children . Greater enforcement of Australian vaping laws is needed 
to  ensure  nicotine-containing  vaping  products  are  only  accessible  to 
adult smokers for smoking cessation. 

An additional noteworthy finding from our study is the difference in 
perceptions of vaping safety between ever-vapers and never-vapers, as 
well as between parents and teenagers. Specifically, ever-vapers were 
generally less aligned with negative safety statements and more aligned 
with  positive  ones  than  never-vapers.  Moreover,  teenagers  tended  to 
have  lower  agreement  with  negative  safety  statements  and  higher 
agreement with positive safety statements compared to parents. These 
divergent views suggest that health education campaigns aimed at ad-
olescents could potentially be beneficial in addressing misconceptions 
about the safety and harms of vaping. Furthermore, even though parents 
in our study generally had a more accurate perception of vaping risks, 
tailored information (encompassing resources and support), including 
for  vaping parents, may  assist in clarifying misperceptions  that could 
influence their children’s attitudes towards vaping. The potential ben-
efits  of  tailoring  parent-specific  information  become  even  more  pro-
nounced considering our finding that parents possess high awareness of 
their  teenager’s  vaping  habits.  Such  tailored  information  would  be 
perceived as highly relevant by parents of ever-vapers who are aware of 
their child’s vaping behaviours, thus increasing the likelihood of their 
active engagement. 

Our study has limitations. First, the analysis assessing the accuracy of 
parent’s belief about their teenage child’s vaping is based on a question 
that doesn’t necessarily refer to the 14–17-year-old child who completed 
the  survey  (i.e  the  question  asks  “...  has  your  child  (or  any  of  your 
children aged 14–17) ever vaped?”). Consequently, while our analysis 
suggests parents have a high level of awareness of one of their teenage 
child’s vaping status, the true level may be higher if some parents are 
referring to a different 14–17-year-old child with a discordant vaping 
status to the child who completed the survey. Second, our study exam-
ines only one parent’s smoking and vaping behaviours, which may not 
capture  the  full  family  context  influencing  a  teen’s  behaviour.  This 
limitation could attenuate estimated associations and would seemingly 
be  more  of  a  problem  when  the  responding  parent  does  not  vape  or 
smoke,  but  other  parent  figures  do,  compared  to  when  only  the 
responding parent vapes or smokes, but other parent figures do not. On 
the other hand, if there is a strong correlation between the behaviours of 
all parent figures, this limitation will be less impactful. Future waves of 
the study will consider including questions about non-responding par-
ent’s smoking and vaping status. 

Addressing  the  rapid  rise  in  adolescent  vaping  is  a  public  health 
priority in Australia . Our results show that parental smoking and vaping im-
pacts  on  both  teenagers’  vaping  and  smoking  behaviours,  suggesting
